# Avengers Data
## Open avengers_project.md to see analysis

I have been trying to learn, so I my goal here was to get some practice with a data set I thought was interesting.

I found a small data set about the Marvel Avengers, which I found on [DataHub](https://datahub.io/five-thirty-eight/avengers). It has information about how many times each Avenger has died and come back, when they became and Avenger, and how appearances they make in media.

I wanted to see just how many Avengers have died and what your chances are of dying as an Avenger. Turns out it is pretty likely! Overall, I wanted to see what information I could pull from such a small data set.

# Data Analysis Results

What are your chances of dying as an Avenger?
* There is a 39.9% chance of dying if you are an Avenger
What are your chances of coming back to life after dying once as an Avenger?
* There is a 66.7% chance of coming back to life after dying once

# Development Environment

I decided to use the R language for my data analysis. I chose RStudio as my IDE. R and RStudio are both straightforward and fairly easy to learn, so I didn't have much trouble getting used to them.

I used a couple of libraries in R. The first one, tidyverse, is a required package that comes with many useful cleaning and plotting functions like ggplot. The other library, ggrepel, allows you to put labels on a plot and they will automatically seperate themselves to make them easier to read.

# Future Work

* Experiment with different and more interesting visuals
* Add a death counter to see a number of how many times each person has died
* Look at different, bigger data sets
